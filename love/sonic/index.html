    <h1>Sonic the Hedgehog</h1>
    <p>There's a lot to love about the Sonic franchise. From the gameplay - momentum-based, fast-paced and endlessly fun - to the story - uplifting, cheerful and with some genuine heartfelt messages about environmental action and heroism - there are a million excellent reasons why the blue blur has become the pop culture phenomenon he is today. This page is going to be dedicated to me going game by game (or show or comic) through the franchise as I experience it, and talking about what I love most about each one.</p>

    <h2>Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)</h2>
    <p><img src="/icons_and_such/sonicmv.gif"></p>
    <p>This game is absolutely iconic. To be honest, like most retro games, it's easy to tell that the team was still working out what the game was supposed to be *cough cough marble zone cough cough* but there are also some moments of absolutely genius gameplay. The music and visuals are also just delightful. Deserves its reputation as a classic.</p>
    <h2>Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (1993)</h2>
    <p>SNOOPING AS USUAL I SEE! We are still in the phase of working out what Sonic as a franchise is going to be, but honestly I think this Looney Tunes knock off could be far worse. The fast paced 90s comedy is just slap in the face after slap in the face, in the best possible way, and it genuinely makes me laugh throughout entire episodes. Not to mention Robotnik's stunning performance which has led to the immortality of this show in the form of YTPs and audio clips that most people don't even know the origin of. While it's not what people think of when you say 'Sonic', I think it has certainly deserves more recognition than it gets.</p>
    <h2>Sonic the Hedgehog A.K.A. SatAM (1993)</h2>
    <p>Now this is what I'm calling 'missed potential part 1'. SatAM's worldbuilding is frankly incredible. Building off the success of He-Man and other fantasy dystopian kids' cartoons, it creates a genuinely terrifying villain in Robotnik to contrast Adventures Of, and continues to build on the environmentalism message of the original game - something I find sorely lacking in modern Sonic media. Then again, since the 90s our priorities as environmentalists have shifted from small-scale pollution to overall societal change and dealing with climate change, so perhaps it isn't 100% because the Sonic franchise has grown into the kind of capitalist machine it claims to be against. But I digress. I really appreciate Sally as a character and frankly prefer her to early Amy, purely because she reads like an actual person and not an overblown girly stalker stereotype. Something about the way the show is framed really makes you feel like Sonic and friends are just kids, making small changes but fundementally powerless, in a world which doesn't care for them. It's hopeless, and yet hopeful - they never give up, no matter how hopeless things feel. The overall writing could do with some work, but the concept and vibes are immaculate. Could really do with a modern reboot.</p>
    <h2>Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA) (1996)</h2>
    <p>Ah, 'missed potential part 2'. Firstly, I love the voice acting. I know, I know, it's controversial, but they have so much personality and charm! Secondly, the overall world building is absolutely fabulous and I would have loved to see where they went with this. This incarnation of Mobius as floating islands above a wrecked post-dystopian world absolutely fascinates me. I want to know more! It also makes for a wonderful setpiece. Beyond this, the individual storyline is also delightful with Metal Sonic taking the spotlight. He has personality and charm, and I adore the idea of him being mentally linked to Sonic. It's kinda heartbreaking. Plus you've got the iconic STRANGE, ISN'T IT? line! The gorgeous soundtrack wraps this whole thing up in a wonderful little bow. I wish we could have more of this in the modern era, beyond the odd 'Knuckles has his hat back' reference.</p>
    <h2>Sonic Forces (2017)</h2>
    <p>For the best experience, listen to this game's soundtrack and never play the game itself. GOD. It had such a cool concept but the combination of the awful gameplay and the way the story never quite delved as deep as I think it should have mean it's basically a nothing game to me. Fist Bump is still based though.</p>
    <h2>IDW Sonic the Hedgehog Comic (2018)</h2>
    <p>First off, in this comic Sonic is just like me forreal. Literally every page with Sonic on it, something would happen, I would react, I'd look at the next panel and Sonic is doing the same thing. So yeah, IDW is winning with the relatable protagonist. I really love this depiction of Sonic. Literally! I love the art style. Probably my favourite modern depiction of Sonic. Better than the games, definitely. Also, Ian Flynn is a writing genius. I really like how the plotline goes back to Sonic's eco-warrior origins while also diving into more serious topics.</p>
    <p>Flynn strikes a marvellous balance between his darker plotlines, and the fact that Sonic is a lighthearted series at its core. It's a current trend of superhero media to keep ramping up the stakes higher and higher, because someone decided at some point that cheerful stuff can't be taken seriously. And honestly, a darker plotline is kind of necessary these days to get the point across when it comes to a climate driven story. Kids these days aren't going to be frightened by Eggman dumping chemicals in the river because that already happened, probably to the river next to their house. Pollution isn't the big environmentalist story anymore - it's climate change. And how does one get across the looming finality of the end of the world in a child-friendly and engaging manner while also providing a way to win? How can you give hope in that kind of situation?</p>
    <p>Yeah, I'm talking about the zombot arc.</p>
    <p>It's genuinely haunting, and I think that's the magic of it. Everyone reading the comic knows that Sonic is going to come out on top. But seeing him infected, constantly having to be on the move and abandon his friends and his morals in order to stay alive, that's harrowing! It's only by confronting the problem head-on that Sonic is able to save himself and his friends. And I think that can definitely be taken as a climate change allegory. Mitigating actions can only go so far - it's only by dealing with the problem directly that we'll be able to save everyone, not just the powerful.</p>
    <p>I also really appreciate the new characters. Tangle and Whisper are both breaths of fresh air in the historically male-dominated series, with both proving to be excellent characters whose genders aren't plot points, like most other female Sonic characters. Surge and Kit are also my new best friends, and I think Surge probably has my favourite design of any Sonic character beside the blue blur himself. I'm really excited to see where the story takes them!</p>
    <h2>Sonic Frontiers (2022)</h2>
    <h3>On Release</h3>
    <p>AND WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS BABES!!!!! I will be completely honest. Sonic Frontiers is a mid game at best. But you know what? That means it's not trash! It's fun! Sure there are some janky cyberspace stages, and some of the open world specific features felt slow, and it's super annoying I can't go back to beat bosses, but on the whole I had a bunch of fun playing this game. Especially the bosses. This is the best Super Sonic gameplay we have ever seen, and the overdramatic anime-esque takedowns were exactly what this franchise needed in terms of sheer fun value. This game takes itself just seriously enough. Not to mention the fact that we're finally acknowledging old SA-era lore about the Ancients and Angel Island and stuff - and they're namedropping Sticks and Tangle in a mainline game! Ian Flynn has a lot of critics, but I personally enjoy that he seems to be pulling everything back into a somewhat coherent story. This feels like a refresh, and with a year of updates planned, I can't wait to see where this game is going next.</p>
    <h3>After Birthday Update</h3>
    <p>I think this is the point that I would have released the game at. Honestly, the small quality of life updates here and there have really improved the game for me, to the point where I would rank it as 'great' over 'mid'. The birthday update is absolutely charming, and the various new collectibles have filled out the map to the point that I think was initially intended. Also, the various challenge modes are absolutely awesome and were just what the game needs to add some replayability for me! Not to mention, of course, our lord and saviour the spindash.</p>
